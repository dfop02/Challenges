# Ruby Challenges

Welcome to ruby challenges!!

## Understanding the challenges

Each Challenge has your own directory, each directory has a `x#challenge.txt` file explaining the challenge and a `x#challenge.rb` file that you'll do the challenge.

After build the solution, you can know if you pass on challenge by running the file.
If all validations pass, you complete!
If failed, you can check what happens and re-build the function until reach the fully solution.

The challenges haven't a solution on this repository, for estimule the users to try by themselves.

## Which version can I use?

You can use any version that you want, but we recommend you to use lastest one for practice and try use new features.

## How can I install ruby?

- Ruby Manager like (rvm)[https://rvm.io/] or (rbenv)[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv].
- Download directly from source (here)[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/].
- You also can download using a package manager like apt, brew or any other.
