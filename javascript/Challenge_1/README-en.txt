1# Challenge

Complete the function on challenge.js file.

The function divide an unknown integer into a given number of even parts â€” or at least as even as they can be. The sum of the parts should be the original value, but each part should be an integer, and they should be as close as possible.

Parameters:

num: Integer - The number that should be split into equal parts
parts: Integer - The number of parts that the number should be split into

Return Value List (of Integers) - A list of parts, with each index representing the part and the number contained within it representing the size of the part. The parts will be ordered from smallest to largest.

Example:
Input => 10 5
Output => [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Input => 20 6
Output => [3,3,3,3,4,4]
